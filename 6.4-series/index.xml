      <description>Note ODBC and SQLite(distributed with Qt) are built in the backage. All Dynamic builds have -DFEATURE_sql_xxx=ON -DFEATURE_system_sqlite=OFF.
Note Since Qt 6.2 Qt made SSL backends as plugin. We build SChannel and OpenSSL backend plugin, with OpenSSL backend built with OpenSSL 3 series. Additionally, Visual Studio versions of Qt builds supports TLS 1.3 using SecureTransport.
Note All builds have -DFEATURE_icu=OFF because I think the ICU library is too big and, in most of the conditions, useless for common users.</description>

Note Since Qt 6.2 Qt made SSL backends as plugin. We build OpenSSL backend plugin with OpenSSL 3 series.
Note Since Qt 6.3 I drop 32-bit builds for community.
Note All builds have -DFEATURE_icu=OFF because I think the ICU library is too big and, in most of the conditions, useless for common users.
Note All builds are using NDK r25b with -DANDROID_NATIVE_API_LEVEL=27, it means the APK built using these packages may be not able to run on Android 8.</description>

      <description>Note SQLite(distributed with Qt) are built in the backage and have -plugin-sql-sqlite
Note All packages have -no-ssl because of compile failure with -ssl -openssl-linked.
Note All builds have -no-icu because I think the ICU library is too big and, in most of the conditions, useless for common users.
Note All builds are using emscripten SDK 3.1.14. All builds are with -feature-threads.
Note Qt for WebAssembly can&amp;rsquo;t be built to shared libs.</description>
