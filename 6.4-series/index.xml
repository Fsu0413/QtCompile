      <description>Note ODBC and SQLite (distributed with Qt) are built in the package using -DFEATURE_sql_***=ON -DFEATURE_system_sqlite=OFF Note Since Qt 6.2 Qt made SSL backends as plugin. We build SChannel and OpenSSL backend plugin, with OpenSSL backend built with OpenSSL 3 series. Additionally, Visual Studio versions of Qt builds supports TLS 1.3 using SecureTransport.
Note All builds have -DFEATURE_icu=OFF because I think the ICU library is too big and, in most of the conditions, useless for common users.</description>

Note Since Qt 6.3 I drop 32-bit builds for community.
Note All builds have -DFEATURE_icu=OFF because I think the ICU library is too big and, in most of the conditions, useless for common users. Note All builds are using NDK r25b with -DANDROID_NATIVE_API_LEVEL=27, it means the APK built using these packages may be not able to run on Android 8.</description>

      <description>Note SQLite (distributed with Qt) are built in the package using -DFEATURE_sql_sqlite=ON -DFEATURE_system_sqlite=OFF Note All builds have -DFEATURE_icu=OFF because I think the ICU library is too big and, in most of the conditions, useless for common users. Note All packages are built using emscripten SDK 3.1.14 as recommended in Qt Wiki.
WebAssembly doesn&amp;rsquo;t support ABI compatibility. You MUST use SDK 3.1.14 for building your own code, otherwise unpredicted error may occur.</description>
