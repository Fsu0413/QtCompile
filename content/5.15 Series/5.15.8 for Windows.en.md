{{% notice style="info" title="Note"  icon="fas fa-info-circle" %}}
Note: Qt release Qt 5.15 series opensource version a year later than commerical version, while still release QtWebEngine at same time commerical version released.  
That is because QtWebEngine use a thirdparty project which features a license which don't allow closed source.  
Qt Commerical-Only LTS version has had its version up to 5.15.12 so this version is built with QtWebEngine 5.15.12.

## Static `Full` Builds

{{% notice style="info" title="Note"  icon="fas fa-info-circle" %}}
All static builds have `-feature-relocatable`. It should be no need to use QQtPatcher to patch the target binary, but I didn't test it.
