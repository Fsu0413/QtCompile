{{% notice style="info" title="备注"  icon="fas fa-info-circle" %}}
All builds have `-no-openssl -securetransport`. It means that we are using Secure Transport library of macOS to provide SSL connections.

{{% notice style="info" title="备注"  icon="fas fa-info-circle" %}}
All builds have `-no-icu` because I think the ICU library is too big and, in most of the conditions, useless for common users.

## Legacy Builds

{{% notice style="info" title="备注"  icon="fas fa-info-circle" %}}
Note: Qt release Qt 5.15 series opensource version a year later than commerical version, while still release QtWebEngine at same time commerical version released.  
That is because QtWebEngine use a thirdparty project which features a license which don't allow closed source.  
Qt Commerical-Only LTS version has had its version up to 5.15.10 so this version is built with QtWebEngine 5.15.10.
