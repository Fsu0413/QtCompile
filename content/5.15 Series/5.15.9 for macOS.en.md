Note: Qt release Qt 5.15 series opensource version a year later than commerical version, while still release QtWebEngine at same time commerical version released.  
That is because QtWebEngine use a thirdparty project which features a license which don't allow closed source.  
Qt Commerical-Only LTS version has had its version up to 5.15.13 so this version is built with QtWebEngine 5.15.13.
