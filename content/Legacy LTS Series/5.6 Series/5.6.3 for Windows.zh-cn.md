All builds have -openssl-linked. It links to an OpenSSL 1.0.2 series which redistributed in the package. Dynamic builds include dynamic OpenSSL while static builds include static OpenSSL.

All builds have -no-icu because I think the ICU library is too big and, in most of the conditions, useless for common users.

## Static `Full` Builds

{{% notice style="info" title="备注"  icon="fas fa-info-circle" %}}
Static full builds are recompressed by hand.  
Since the parameters configured in 7z GUI is different from default command line which is used in script files, these recompressed package become smaller than the original file.  
Nothing is deleted in the packages.
