ODBC and SQLite(distributed with Qt) are built in the backage. All Dynamic builds have -plugin-sql-xxx.

All builds have -openssl-linked. It links to an OpenSSL 1.0.2 series which redistributed in the package. Dynamic builds include dynamic OpenSSL while static builds include static OpenSSL.

All builds have -no-icu because I think the ICU library is too big and, in most of the conditions, useless for common users.
