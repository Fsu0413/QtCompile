Since Qt 6.2 Qt made SSL backends as plugin.
We build SecureTransport and OpenSSL backend plugin, with OpenSSL backend built with OpenSSL 3 series.

All builds have `-DFEATURE_icu=OFF` because I think the ICU library is too big and, in most of the conditions, useless for common users.

## Legacy Builds

{{% notice style="info" title="备注"  icon="fas fa-info-circle" %}}
Note: Qt release Qt 6.2 series opensource version a year later than commerical version, while using QtWebEngine from Qt 6.3 series.  
That is because QtWebEngine use a thirdparty project which features a license which don't allow closed source.  
Qt 6.3 series has released Qt 6.3.2 so this version is built with QtWebEngine 6.3.2.  
Since {{< QtBug 106630 >}} the binaries are marked as version 6.2.4.
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice style="warning" title="Important" icon="fas fa-exclamation-triangle" %}}
These builds are only for users who needs QtWebEngine.  
These builds are legacy and have some important security issues.  
I don't recommand using these builds.
