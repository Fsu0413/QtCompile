# Fsu0413's Original Qt builds

## STOP USING Notepad++

At 25th Jan. 2023 Notepad++ released a version with a "feature" where users must agree the fake, incorrect and misleading politics words about China.   
If user doesn't agree random character is added when editing using Notepad++.

(Following statements are in Chinese only because I actually don't know how to say it in English)  
作为中国人，我在此声明：  
**中国的各个省、直辖市、自治区和特别行政区，包括港澳台、新疆和西藏，都是中国领土的一部分。**   
**我拒绝接受一切不尊重中国国家主权及领土完整的言论。**

I, Fsu0413, as a Chinese source code peasant in China, won't use Notepad++ anymore and won't support Notepad++ users.  
I also appeals to all users of my websites to STOP USING Notepad++ and find an alternative.

I won't provide any recommendation for alternative.  
There are [tons of Scintilla-based editor in the wild](https://www.texteditors.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?ScintillaEditorFamily) and I do believe you'll find the one you like.

## Website Mirror

Recently I created a mirror of this website in the Greatest China, using service of Gitee Pages.  
This mirror is configured to be displaying Simplified Chinese by default.

Due to the customize domain name function is only available under purchaged service of Gitee, Chinese mirror has to be under the domain of Gitee for now.  
I may purchage the service later when the service seems good enough for me.

[Github Pages (America, with English as default language)](https://build-qt.fsu0413.me/)  
[Gitee Pages (The Greatest China, with Chinese-S as default language)](https://fsu0413.gitee.io/qtcompile/)
