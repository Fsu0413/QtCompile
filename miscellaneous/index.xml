      <description>Reproduciable building I use a set of scripts to do the build and packaging for reproducible building Qt.
If you are interested in build method, please check the following GitHub repo.

Notes on static builds I don&amp;rsquo;t use static builds in huge projects. I don&amp;rsquo;t think it is wise to use a static build there.
Maybe you just want to distribute a single portable executable binary file, but there is limitations:</description>

      <description>QQtPatcher Support Status This is a list where QQtPatcher is supported and tested on.
Other version may work, but also may silently fail.
A valid qbp.json is needed for patching Qt 4 Series since qmake -query don&amp;rsquo;t output the makespec.
Qt 5.14 is relocatable as announced in New Features in Qt 5.14, so Qt after 5.14 won&amp;rsquo;t need QQtPatcher anymore.
I delivered QQtPatcher for earlier version of 5.14 (because of the fact that I forgot to modify QQtPatcher related code in build scripts).</description>

      <description>Qt 5.12 WebAssembly builds can&amp;rsquo;t built with OpenSSL Both qsslsocket_opensslpre11.cpp and qsslsocket_openssl11.cpp includes qlibrary.h which is not usable in WebAssembly platform.
Since -openssl and -openssl-linked both use this file, so we can only use -no-ssl&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t try with Qt 5.15 series, but qsslsocket_openssl.cpp in Qt 5.15 includes qlibrary.h as well&amp;hellip;
I didn&amp;rsquo;t try with Qt 6.2 onwards.
Update 2022.11.6:
I gave up supporting SSL on WebAssembly and will remove this item later.</description>

      <description>2022.8.23 Update Qt 5.12.12 with OpenSSL 1.1.1q.
Update Qt 6.2.4 with patch of CVE-2022-27404-27405-27406 and OpenSSL 3.0.5.
Update Qt 6.3.1 WebAssembly builds, which are built using emscripten SDK 3.1.6.
Qt 5.15.5 is not updated since patch of CVE-2022-27404-27405-27406 provided by Qt conflicts with 5.15.5 code base.
I&amp;rsquo;ll wait for 5.15.6 and will release without the patch if this patch doesn&amp;rsquo;t work on 5.15.6 either.
Qt 6.3.1 is not updated. Let&amp;rsquo;s wait for 6.</description>
