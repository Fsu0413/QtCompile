      <description>Note ODBC and SQLite (distributed with Qt) are built in the package using -sql-*** Note All builds have -no-openssl -schannel, which means that Windows Secure Channel is used for TLS Backend.
This backend is supported by Qt since Qt 5.13. Note All builds have -no-icu because I think the ICU library is too big and, in most of the conditions, useless for common users. Note Note: Qt release Qt 5.</description>

      <description>Note SQLite (distributed with Qt) are built in the package using -sql-sqlite Note All builds have -no-openssl -securetransport, which means that Secure Transport library provided by macOS is used for TLS Backend.
This backend is supported by Qt since Qt 5.6. Note All builds have -no-icu because I think the ICU library is too big and, in most of the conditions, useless for common users. Note No QtWebEngine in this version.</description>

      <title>5.15.8 for Android</title>
      <link>/5.15-series/5.15.8-for-android/index.html</link>

      <description>Note SQLite (distributed with Qt) are built in the package using -sql-sqlite Note All builds have -openssl-linked, which means that OpenSSL is linked to Qt and is used for TLS Backend.
It links to a static OpenSSL 1.1.1 series.
Android since version 6.0 is using BoringSSL for its builtin SSL / TLS library.
It is NOT API COMPATIBLE WITH OpenSSL and can&amp;rsquo;t be used.
Note All builds have -no-icu because I think the ICU library is too big and, in most of the conditions, useless for common users.</description>

      <description>Note SQLite (distributed with Qt) are built in the package using -sql-sqlite Note All builds have -no-icu because I think the ICU library is too big and, in most of the conditions, useless for common users. Note All packages are built using emscripten SDK 1.39.8 as recommended in Qt Wiki.
WebAssembly doesn&amp;rsquo;t support ABI compatibility. You MUST use SDK 1.39.8 for building your own code, otherwise unpredicted error may occur.</description>
