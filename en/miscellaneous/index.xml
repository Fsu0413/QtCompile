      <description>Chinese / Multilingual Support This website was English only since when it was initially built, although the maintainer of this website (me, Fsu0413) is a Chinese native speaker from the PRC.
Currently I am gradually adding Simplified Chinese support on this website.
Recently this website has gained multilingual support thanks to the built-in multilingual support of Hugo and the recently switched Relearn theme.
Current Chinese support is in the stage of writing texts.</description>

      <description>QQtPatcher Support Status This is a list where QQtPatcher is supported and tested on.
Other version may work, but also may silently fail.
A valid qbp.json is needed for patching Qt 4 Series since qmake -query don&amp;rsquo;t output the makespec.
Qt 5.14 is relocatable as announced in New Features in Qt 5.14, so Qt after 5.14 won&amp;rsquo;t need QQtPatcher anymore.
I delivered QQtPatcher for earlier version of 5.14 (because of the fact that I forgot to modify QQtPatcher related code in build scripts).</description>

      <description>QDoc after Qt 5.12 cannot use static linked clang when using MSVC It uses libclang_static.lib but clang don&amp;rsquo;t provide this one.
I have decided not provide LLVM-based QDoc until I find a way to static link it.
Update 2020.11.3:
libclang_static.lib is packed seprately using script by Qt guys.
Thanks &amp;ldquo;lixinwei&amp;rdquo; on QTCN.org for telling me related info. Original post (Sorry, it&amp;rsquo;s in Chinese)
Command line too long when building Qt 6.</description>
