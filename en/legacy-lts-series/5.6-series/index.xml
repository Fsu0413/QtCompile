      <description>Important FINAL VERSION, NO MORE UPDATES EVEN IF REQUESTED, BUILD ENVIRONMENT HAS BEEN DESTRUCTED Note ODBC and SQLite (distributed with Qt) are built in the package using -plugin-sql-*** Note All builds have -openssl-linked, which means that OpenSSL is linked to Qt and is used for TLS Backend.
It links to an OpenSSL 1.0.2 series which redistributed in the package.
Dynamic builds include dynamic OpenSSL while static builds include static OpenSSL.</description>

      <title>5.6.3 for macOS</title>
      <link>/qtcompile/en/legacy-lts-series/5.6-series/5.6.3-for-macos/index.html</link>

      <description>Important FINAL VERSION, NO MORE UPDATES EVEN IF REQUESTED, BUILD ENVIRONMENT HAS BEEN DESTRUCTED Note SQLite (distributed with Qt) are built in the package using -plugin-sql-sqlite Note All builds have -no-openssl -securetransport, which means that Secure Transport library provided by macOS is used for TLS Backend.
This backend is supported by Qt since Qt 5.6. Note All builds have -no-icu because I think the ICU library is too big and, in most of the conditions, useless for common users.</description>

      <description>Important FINAL VERSION, NO MORE UPDATES EVEN IF REQUESTED, BUILD ENVIRONMENT HAS BEEN DESTRUCTED Note SQLite (distributed with Qt) are built in the package using -plugin-sql-sqlite Note All builds have -openssl-linked, which means that OpenSSL is linked to Qt and is used for TLS Backend.
It links to a static OpenSSL 1.0.2 series.
Android since version 6.0 is using BoringSSL for its builtin SSL / TLS library.
It is NOT API COMPATIBLE WITH OpenSSL and can&amp;rsquo;t be used.</description>
