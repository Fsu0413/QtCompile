      <description>Important FINAL VERSION, NO MORE UPDATES EVEN IF REQUESTED, BUILD ENVIRONMENT HAS BEEN DESTRUCTED
Note ODBC and SQLite(distributed with Qt) are built in the backage. All Dynamic builds have -plugin-sql-xxx.
Note All builds have -openssl-linked. It links to an OpenSSL 1.0.2 series which redistributed in the package. Dynamic builds include dynamic OpenSSL while static builds include static OpenSSL.
Note All builds have -no-icu because I think the ICU library is too big and, in most of the conditions, useless for common users.</description>

Note SQLite(distributed with Qt) are built in the backage and have -plugin-sql-sqlite
Note All builds have -no-openssl -securetransport. It means that we are using Secure Transport library of macOS to provide SSL connections.

Note SQLite(distributed with Qt) are built in the backage and have -plugin-sql-sqlite
Note All packages have -openssl-linked, Since BoringSSL, which is used in Android 6.0 or later, is NOT API COMPATIBLE WITH OPENSSL, we link it to a static OpenSSL 1.0.2 series instead of system SSL library.
