      <description>Note ODBC and SQLite (distributed with Qt) are built in the package using -DFEATURE_sql_***=ON -DFEATURE_system_sqlite=OFF Note Since Qt 6.2 Qt made TLS backends as plugin.
Following backend(s) are built in the package:
OpenSSL 3.0 series using -DFEATURE_openssl=ON -DINPUT_openssl=linked for enabling linked OpenSSL support Windows Secure Channel using -DFEATURE_schannel=ON with TLS 1.3 support on MSVC version Note All builds have -DFEATURE_icu=OFF because I think the ICU library is too big and, in most of the conditions, useless for common users.</description>

Following backend(s) are built in the package:
OpenSSL 3.0 series using -DFEATURE_openssl=ON -DINPUT_openssl=linked for enabling linked OpenSSL support Secure Transport library provided by macOS using -DFEATURE_securetransport=ON Note All builds have -DFEATURE_icu=OFF because I think the ICU library is too big and, in most of the conditions, useless for common users.</description>

Note All builds are using NDK r23c with -DANDROID_NATIVE_API_LEVEL=24, it means the APK built using these packages may be not able to run on Android 7.</description>

      <title>6.2.4 for WebAssembly</title>
      <link>/qtcompile/en/6.2-series/6.2.4-for-webassembly/index.html</link>

Note All packages are built using emscripten SDK 2.0.14 as recommended in Qt Wiki.
WebAssembly doesn&amp;rsquo;t support ABI compatibility. You MUST use SDK 2.0.14 for building your own code, otherwise unpredicted error may occur.</description>
