      <description>Note ODBC and SQLite (distributed with Qt) are built in the package using -DFEATURE_sql_***=ON -DFEATURE_system_sqlite=OFF Note Since Qt 6.2 Qt made TLS backends as plugin.
Following backend(s) are built in the package:
OpenSSL 3.0 series using -DFEATURE_openssl=ON -DINPUT_openssl=linked for enabling linked OpenSSL support Windows Secure Channel using -DFEATURE_schannel=ON with TLS 1.3 support on MSVC version Note All builds have -DFEATURE_icu=OFF because I think the ICU library is too big and, in most of the conditions, useless for common users.</description>

Following backend(s) are built in the package:

      <description>Note SQLite (distributed with Qt) are built in the package using -DFEATURE_sql_sqlite=ON -DFEATURE_system_sqlite=OFF Note All builds have -DFEATURE_icu=OFF because I think the ICU library is too big and, in most of the conditions, useless for common users. Note All packages are built using emscripten SDK 3.1.25 as recommended in Qt Wiki.
WebAssembly doesn&amp;rsquo;t support ABI compatibility. You MUST use SDK 3.1.25 for building your own code, otherwise unpredicted error may occur.</description>
