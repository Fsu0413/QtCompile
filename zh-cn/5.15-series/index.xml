      <description>备注 ODBC and SQLite(distributed with Qt) are built in the backage. All Dynamic builds have -plugin-sql-xxx.
备注 All builds have -schannel which use Windows Secure Channel SSL backend.
备注 All builds have -no-icu because I think the ICU library is too big and, in most of the conditions, useless for common users.
备注 Note: Qt release Qt 5.15 series opensource version a year later than commerical version, while still release QtWebEngine at same time commerical version released.</description>

      <description>备注 SQLite(distributed with Qt) are built in the backage and have -plugin-sql-sqlite
备注 All packages have -openssl-linked, Since BoringSSL, which is used in Android 6.0 or later, is NOT API COMPATIBLE WITH OPENSSL, we link it to a static OpenSSL 1.1.1 series instead of system SSL library.
备注 All builds have -no-icu because I think the ICU library is too big and, in most of the conditions, useless for common users.</description>
