      <description>Note ODBC and SQLite(distributed with Qt) are built in the backage. All Dynamic builds have -DFEATURE_sql_xxx=ON -DFEATURE_system_sqlite=OFF.
Note Since Qt 6.2 Qt made SSL backends as plugin.
We build SChannel and OpenSSL backend plugin, with OpenSSL backend built with OpenSSL 3 series.
Additionally, Visual Studio versions of Qt builds supports TLS 1.3 using SecureTransport.
Note All builds have -DFEATURE_icu=OFF because I think the ICU library is too big and, in most of the conditions, useless for common users.</description>
